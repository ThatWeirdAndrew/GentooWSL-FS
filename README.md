## Building
CI Builds won't be working until Jan 2020 because I ran out of credits. If you would like to build it for yourself, you can run the `build-x64.sh` script on Ubuntu or Debian.

## Other stuff
The cpu.sh script is from [this](https://blechtog.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/gentoo-autoconfigure-number-of-cpu-in-make-conf/) site
